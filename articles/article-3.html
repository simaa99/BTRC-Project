              <p>
                Many of us have faced this situation many times in our lives: in
                the morning, the day seems long, a lot of things are planned,
                the plan looks quite structured and feasible. But then time
                seems to disappear. It suddenly becomes less than you had
                planned in the morning. But after all, you were calculating
                strictly by the clock, how could you get such simple math wrong?
                It's as if someone has absorbed some of the time. And these
                phenomena have a name: chronophages. So how do they absorb or
                steal our time? What do they look like and can they be
                countered? In terms of theories of cognitive psychology and
                theories of human behavior, these questions can be answered more
                or less clearly. Let's deal with everything in order.
                <br />
                <br />
                On the one hand, of course, everything depends on our attention
                and behavior throughout the day, how exactly we perform tasks.
                The theory of selective attention suggests that our perception
                of time can be significantly influenced by what we focus our
                attention on. Tasks that require intense focus can cause us to
                lose track of time. This happens because the brain simply lacks
                the resources to be both focused on the task at hand and to
                estimate time at the same time. This effect is exacerbated if a
                person is working on multiple tasks at once. Keeping track of
                time while multitasking is extremely difficult. Because of this,
                our perception of time is often distorted by complex work or a
                large number of simultaneous tasks.
                <br />
                <br />
                On the other hand, time perception is strongly influenced by
                hormones and brain chemistry. In particular, the two most
                important neurotransmitters involved are dopamine and serotonin.
                Dopamine plays a role in reward and motivation and is linked to
                time perception. Dopaminergic activity can alter time
                perception, often speeding it up during tasks with high reward
                or high motivation. Serotonin, on the other hand, is involved in
                mood regulation, its levels can affect time perception, and
                imbalances can lead to disorders that affect time perception
                (e.g., depression often leads to feelings of time dragging).
                Thus, our perception of our time while doing some task depends
                on the value of that task to us, our interest in motivation and
                outcome. The more interesting or pleasant the task is, the more
                important it is, the faster time flies. And the periods of such
                work are perceived in a completely different way than they
                looked on your schedule and plan from the morning.
                <br />
                <br />
                Besides the perception of time in the moment itself, there is
                another important aspect: do we make mistakes when estimating
                and planning time? In this regard, there are two main processes
                in our psyche: retrospective and prospective perception of time.
                 Retrospective evaluation is an assessment of how much time has
                passed since an event. A number of memory processes can lead to
                distortions, making some periods of time seem longer or shorter
                than they actually were. This shows that sometimes our memories
                of a productive day cannot be relied upon to plan the next day,
                because in fact we often misremember how long a particular
                process took. On the other hand, in prospective evaluation, when
                one realizes that one needs to keep track of time (e.g., when
                one is waiting for something), time may seem to drag. Cognitive
                theories suggest that this is because we are actively watching
                the clock, increasing our awareness of the passing time and
                directing more of our attention and the brain's computational
                resources to it.
                <br />
                <br />
                Finally, activities such as excessive use of social media, video
                games, and internet browsing can act as chronophages, consuming
                significant amounts of time often without the user realizing it.
                Cognitive psychologists study these behaviors to understand how
                attention and interaction with digital media alter perceptions
                of time. The design of many digital platforms aims to create
                immersive experiences that encourage prolonged use. Because of
                this, when the mind wanders, people often lose track of time
                without noticing how much time is spent on similar activities
                and entertainment. The amount of time spent is difficult to
                estimate both at the time of such activities and when
                remembering a particular day.
                <br />
                <br />
                Thus, our own psyche prevents us from assessing time
                objectively. And in order to somehow navigate in this, we can
                note the following ways. First, it is necessary to divide large
                tasks into many small ones, the time spent on which can be at
                least objectively measured. Secondly, it is important to
                strictly dose the time devoted to social networks, video games
                and other such activities. Thirdly, it is necessary to monitor
                the distribution of your attention. When working, regular breaks
                are important, even in conditions of multitasking attention
                should not wander or switch too quickly. Well, and finally,
                fourthly, to each case should be approached with a moderately
                positive attitude. Work should not be a bore, but at the same
                time and too fixated on the result or process is not worth it.
                Over-motivation is no less harmful than lack of it and can lead
                to incorrect time estimation, distribution of forces or burnout.
