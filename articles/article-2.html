                It is said that happy people do not notice the passage of time;
                in joyful moments it feels as if someone turns on the rewind of
                events and speeds up the change of one moment to another. When
                people are bored, it seems as if time moves like a turtle. Do
                emotions always have such a strong influence on our perception
                of time? And is it possible, being happy, to “stop the moment”
                to enjoy it more? Or is a slow and leisurely life only available
                to bored and sad people? Research in cognitive psychology can
                help shed some light on this. Scientists agree that emotions
                have a powerful influence on the perception of time. But
                determining what the impact of a particular emotion is, how and
                why it happens, is already much more complicated.
                <br />
                <br />
                Let's start with the simplest question: can emotions have a
                strong influence on time perception at all, and why should this
                be the case? A team of scientists from the universities of
                Shanghai and Nagoya conducted an experimental study published in
                the journal Frontiers in psychology and came to the conclusion
                that the stronger the emotions and emotional excitement - the
                slower time is perceived. By showing experimental participants
                different stimuli (pictures and video clips) with different
                durations and different emotional content, the researchers found
                that the higher the emotional awareness and attention paid to
                emotions, the stronger the emotions and the slower the time
                slowing effect. But why does this happen? How can emotions slow
                or stop time? There are various hypotheses on this topic.
                However, the main hypotheses are two. First, it is hypothesized
                that high levels of arousal increase attention to the passage of
                time, causing time to slow down. This is sometimes referred to
                as the “time dilation” effect. Strong arousal increases sensory
                input and cognitive processing, making time intervals seem
                longer. Emotions, on the other hand, especially strong emotions,
                are more likely to cause strong arousal, which can cause time
                perception to slow down. Second, it is theorized that when
                cognitive resources are highly engaged by emotional stimuli,
                fewer resources are available for time estimation, leading to
                distortions in time perception. Because of too much overload of
                emotional centers, the brain, like a computer, simply doesn't
                have enough resources and starts to “lag”.

                <br />
                <br />

                But is there a difference in the influence of different
                emotions? Are the common opinions about time speeding up with
                happiness and slowing down with sadness or fear true? From the
                point of view of cognitive psychology, yes. But only partially,
                because it's not that simple. Studies have shown that fear and
                anxiety can cause time to feel like it's slowing down. For
                example, when people are put in threatening situations, they
                often report that time feels like it's crawling. This is thought
                to be an adaptive response, allowing more time to respond to
                potential danger. In a study in which participants were shown
                scary or threatening images, they rated the duration of these
                images as longer compared to neutral images. The same effect is
                seen in depressed or sad moods: depressed people often perceive
                the duration of time intervals as longer compared to
                non-depressed people .
                <br />
                <br />
                On the other hand, positive emotions such as happiness can also
                influence the perception of time, but their influence is less
                robust. Some studies show that time flies faster when people are
                having fun, which is in line with the saying “time flies when
                you're having fun”. This may be due to the fact that people pay
                less attention to the flow of time.
                <br />
                <br />
                The final and most important question remains: can this be
                managed at least to some extent? How can we influence the flow
                of time to make happy moments longer and ten-minute waits not
                infinite? Based on cognitive research and its results - yes, a
                person can become to some extent the master of his time. Here is
                a short list of time management tips from a cognitive
                psychologist and expert at Bakkoura Global Time Research Center:
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>1) </strong>
                 Try to keep emotional stress under control. Joyful and sad
                emotions can cause a storm of feelings, but remember: everything
                is temporary, all moments will eventually pass. In sadness,
                remember that this is just a phase of life, something you need
                to experience. In joy, try not to be in a hurry. Stop, savor the
                moment. Try to hold on to your inspiration longer, even if you
                feel like you're about to turn mountains or become a top Apple
                executive. If you're scared or unsure of yourself - assess the
                situation objectively, give yourself time to make a decision and
                rest. Taking care of yourself is incredibly important. Your
                emotions shouldn’t violently rush over the edge, but flow
                calmly.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>2) </strong>
                 Develop a certain rhythm of life that is comfortable for you,
                which you will stick to. Time in human perception is first of
                all a rhythm (there is a separate article about it on the
                Center's website). Therefore, the most important aspect of time
                control is to develop a working and life rhythm. If such a
                rhythm can be established, many emotions, even if strong, will
                have much less influence on your perception of time.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>3) </strong>
                Try contemplative or reflective practices that are appropriate
                for you. Meditations (as physical and mental exercises, not
                esoteric techniques), evening walks, distracted contemplation,
                slow, careful and meditative activities as hobbies (weaving,
                knitting, kintsugi, etc.) can help develop your ability to
                control your attention. ) can help develop the ability to
                control attention, emotion and concentration, and create small
                loci of silence in the hustle and bustle of everyday life, where
                you can take your mind off the everyday and clear your head of
                intrusive thoughts and strong emotions.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>4) </strong>
                 Everything has its time and place. Keep a balance between work
                and rest, it is an extremely important part of the daily rhythm.
                A proper work/rest balance will help you set your internal clock
                to regularly devote some time to work and other time to rest
                without difficulty. This should be present not only on a macro
                level (how much and what things to do today, tomorrow, next
                week), but also on a micro level: how much to do a particular
                task. Breaks are important in this respect: a person can stay
                maximally concentrated only from 25 minutes to an hour and a
                half. Therefore, every hour or hour and a half you should take
                small breaks from your current work, five or ten minutes at a
                time. This can greatly increase productivity and save you from
                overwork and burnout. In addition, location is also very
                important. Try to have separate areas for work, leisure and
                hobbies. As we know from cognitive behavioral therapy, many of
                our reactions, emotional or rational, depend on our behavior
                patterns. If you work in the same environment all the time, over
                time the psyche will adapt to it and incorporate that
                environment into the workflow, allowing you to filter out
                unnecessary or overly harsh emotional reactions just by stepping
                into a room (or even an area of a room, at home a desk can be
                set aside for work, and a sofa area, living room, etc. can be
                set aside for relaxation). This will allow you to separate the
                emotions that you want to feel during work and emotions from
                rest, hobbies, communication with family, etc.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>5) </strong>
                 Doze the time you spend on social media. A lot of social media
                is built on giving you an easy endorphin rush, to supply you
                with strong impressions just like that, on a platter. And the
                flow of those impressions when flipping through social media is
                very fast. All of this together can unsettle your nervous
                system, making emotions more fluid and concentration more
                challenging. Therefore, don't spend too much time on social
                media. Moreover, when you don't want to look at social media,
                it's best not to pick up your phone. Cognitive studies show that
                even if we take out our phone to just look at the time, we end
                up at least looking at notifications, and in many cases, we also
                start scrolling through social media feeds. Therefore, to
                determine the time in everyday life is better to use a
                wristwatch. And mechanical or classic digital watches are better
                suited for this task than smartwatches, because smartwatches
                usually have the ability to view notifications, which, as
                mentioned above, can be distracting and disrupt the work rhythm.
