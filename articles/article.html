                What does the present moment look like, the one and only “now”
                moment? What do you imagine when you hear “now”: a picture, a
                still frame from a movie, maybe a fragment of a movie or a
                sound? Psychologists believe the last answer is the most
                correct. Recent research in cognitive psychology and human
                perception (e.g., an article in the Journal of Modern Foreign
                Psychology) shows that a person is much more accurate in
                determining the length of time a sound is played than the length
                of time a picture is shown. Moreover, if we show first the
                picture and then the picture and the sound at the same time, the
                second answer will be more accurate. We can say that when it
                comes to time, a person chooses sound as his or her internal
                chronometer. Therefore, if you want to try to catch a glimpse of
                the present, it is worth listening. Moreover, a study published
                in the journal Consciousness and Cognition shows that if you
                distribute words denoting the past and words denoting the future
                to the left and right, respectively, of the zero point (“now”)
                and then let people listen to these words, those denoting the
                future will be perceived louder by the right ear. This shows
                that visual and auditory perception are strongly linked, and
                sometimes one can dictate the rules of the game to the other.
                And if space is perceived by sight, presented as a picture, then
                time is like a sound sequence. And it is hearing and sound that
                will better let us know how long a particular moment lasts.
                <br />
                <br />

                In addition, sound can distort a person's perception of time.
                Sound-induced time distortion is a phenomenon studied in
                cognitive psychology and neuroscience in which auditory stimuli
                affect time perception. The brain processes time intervals using
                neural mechanisms, and auditory stimuli, particularly rhythmic
                sounds, can alter the process and outcome of this processing.
                When listening to a series of sounds, our perception of time can
                slow down or speed up depending on the rhythm and tempo. Studies
                show that regular rhythmic sounds make time intervals seem
                shorter, whereas irregular or unexpected sounds make time
                intervals seem longer. This effect is due to the expectation and
                prediction mechanisms that operate in the brain, where regular
                patterns are processed more efficiently. Disturbances or
                variations in sound patterns, changes in rhythm lead to changes
                in the perception of time because of the way these neural
                circuits process information. In everyday life, this phenomenon
                is manifested by the fact that time seems to go faster when the
                tempo of music is fast, and slower when the tempo is monotonous
                or slow. Experimental results have shown that participants'
                estimation of time is significantly affected by sound patterns,
                with increasing tempo leading to underestimation and decreasing
                tempo leading to overestimation of time intervals. Thus, time in
                human perception is primarily a rhythm. The human psyche has its
                own internal rhythms, but we often perceive the world in
                relation to external rhythms. By controlling the rhythm of sound
                sequences, we can slow down or speed up our perception of time,
                control it. The rhythm of life is not just a beautiful metaphor,
                it is one of the names of time.
                <br />
                <br />

                Considering the perception of time as a perception of sound, or
                more specifically, rhythm, gives a new perspective on the clock
                as a time-measuring device, its design and the way it is used.
                 Claude Debussy said, “Music is the sound between the notes.”
                The “now,” then, is not a mark on the dial. It is the movement
                of the hand and the sound of the trigger. The flow of time is
                continuous, it flows smoothly from one “now” to the next, from
                the click of the trigger to the pause before the next. What is
                most important in this process is rhythmicity, which, at the
                same time, is continuous. A clock is a powerful tool for
                programming and setting up our perception: the sounds around us,
                music, people's voices can change their rhythms, they can be
                disrupted, something unexpected can appear in them. A watch
                always ticks with the same rhythm, its hands move at the same
                speed. This is how clocks create for us a convenient and
                predictable, stable flow of time. But you can perceive this flow
                in different ways, depending on what marks you need for
                traveling on the ocean of time. There are three types of people:
                some appreciate marks and conventional reference points, moving
                along the beaten path of 24 hours and 60 minutes. Others need
                markers too, but disagree with age-old reference points and
                believe they have found a better way to navigate and perceive
                time. Finally, still others believe that it doesn't matter how
                much specific time has passed, they don't care about accuracy to
                the minute or second. The most important thing for them is to
                float from one now to the next, feeling the very passage of time
                as best as possible and enjoying it. Such people are unlikely to
                work in spheres where precise time consistency and punctuality
                are important, they are rather people who like
                unconventionality, creative professions. Their attention may be
                focused on the spiritual sphere, on the feeling of life.
                Bakkoura is preparing a bold and unusual solution to this
                approach to the perception of time: Pulse watch without
                divisions into hours, minutes and seconds, with only one second
                hand. It is a logical continuation of the Open Mind collection
                with minute and hour hands, but without divisions. Such a watch
                can provide a new important experience: the feeling and
                perception of time not in relation to divisions and some
                specific marks, but as a rhythm, a sequence of movements with
                equal speed. It can help to get out of the uncomfortable rhythm
                of life and look at the day from a new perspective. This
                meditation-like approach can be very helpful for those who have
                problems with time management, work rhythm, burnout, and other
                similar problems. No watch alone can fix your life in an
                instant, but a new experience can give you a direction to go in
                and a new open mind about life and time.
